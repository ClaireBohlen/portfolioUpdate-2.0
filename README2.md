**Below is a description of my project: This is structure and outline for my portfolio. I have intro page with four projects, an about page and a contact page. I'm still working on adding more to the contact page but I have the basic idea before I redo this in React JS. Everything is mobile responsive and the nav bar dissapears when you switch to mobile. You can scroll all the way through the page and the bear icon will bring you back to the home page. My projects are on the home page but I'm thinking about moving them to their own page in React.
